## About

This React-based web application was developed for my MSc assignment.  
It demonstrates modern React development practices including component-based architecture, tooling with Vite, and clean UI/UX.  
*(You may want to insert a short sentence about what the app actually does — e.g., a “city search and information” app or whatever the core functionality is.)*

## Features

- Built with React functional components and hooks  
- Fast build and dev environment using Vite  
- Modular, scalable folder structure  
- Responsive design for multiple device sizes  
- ESLint configured for code quality  
*(Add any extra features specific to your app: e.g., API integration, theming, search/filtering, state management, etc.)*

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React  
- **Build Tool / Bundler**: Vite  
- **Linting / Formatting**: ESLint  
- **Languages**: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS  
- **Other libraries**: *(List any libraries used — e.g., React Router, Axios/fetch, styled-components or CSS modules, etc.)*
